"Indigenous Peoples of Nigeria and the 2006 Human Development Report The indigenous peoples of Nigeria include the Mbororo (also known as the Fulanis or Peul), a large group that occupy a number of countries in Central and West Africa, and the Ogoni, who inhabit the southeastern region of NigeriaŠan area known as Ogoniland and located in the northeast plain terraces of the Niger Delta in Rivers",0
The Ogoni people occupied this area for nearly a thousand years before the British came in 1861.,0
They subsist mainly on farming and fishing.26    ,0
The 2006 Human Development Report from Nigeria is the first to focus on one of its six sub-national regionsŠthe Niger Delta.27,0
"This region, with its lucrative oil operations, suffers from ﬁadministrative neglect, crumbling social infrastructure and services, high unemployment, social deprivation, abject poverty, filth and squalor, and endemic conflict.ﬂ28",-4
The Report addresses the unique social and economic needs and concerns of the various peoples of the Niger Delta.,-1
It also mentions the plight of the Ogoni people and other ethnic minorities living in the Delta in the context of land rights issues and the impacts of the oil industry on their livelihoods as well as the environmental resources that they depend on.,-1
"Oil exploration in the Delta has seriously affected the lives of the indigenous communities in this region who have been denied rights to the rich oil resources found on their land, resulting in their livelihood insecurity.",-1
"Protests from the Ogoni community led to massive abuses in human rights, including the execution of an Ogoni",-1
"The Report includes a copy of the Ogoni Bill of Rights drafted in 1990, which lists the state of affairs of the Ogoni people in the Niger Delta and their demands for environmental and sociopolitical rights.   ",0
"Low human development performance in the Niger Delta indicates a struggle to achieve MDG targets, and the HDR states that Nigeria is not likely to meet MDGs, except perhaps in primary school enrollment and gender parity in education.",-1
"The Report, therefore, focuses on identifying major challenges in development in the Niger Delta and promoting strategies to achieve sustainable poverty reduction, to ensure effective use of natural resources, to strengthen local governance, and to build a solid social infrastructure that involves participatory planning and management.",2
The following are the key R: Poverty and inequality,-2
"According to the Report, the incidence of poverty in Nigeria is increasing, and conditions were described as deplorable.",-2
"Huge disparities in development conditions exist between regions, with extremely low performance levels in the Niger Delta where, ironically, oil is produced and natural resources abound.",0
"Revenues from oil, the Niger Delta™s main source of income, are not having an impact on persistent poverty in this region as well as the entire nation, due largely to the inequitable allocation of and access to resources.",-1
"The ascendancy of the oil industry in the Delta also rendered the decline of traditional economies, particularly agriculture, fishery, and forestry.",-1
"Poverty in the Niger Delta includes issues of discrimination, deprivation, inequality, lack of power and security, and lack of access to education, health care, natural resources, and basic amenities.",-6
"It is a result of years of poor governance, administrative neglect, and the exclusion of particular social groups, such as women, youth, and ethnic minorities/indigenous peoples, from participation in decision-making processes that affect their lives.",-3
"To boost economic growth, the Report recommends developing a diversified economy that reduces dependence on existing non-renewable assets such as oil and gas.",2
"An investment on building new industries and improving sustainable livelihoods would help expand employment, productivity, and income, and developing initiatives to cultivate people™s skills is necessary so that they may participate in productive, income-generating activities.",3
"Key to this process, however, is learning new and modern ways of doing business to prevent marginalization.",1
"This could mean alienating and further marginalizing groups, particularly indigenous peoples, who choose to retain their traditional means of subsistence and livelihood.  ",0
"The Report does address the negative impacts of social exclusion and marginalization, stating that the Niger Delta has experienced isolation from the rest of the country™s development process.",-3
"Even within the Delta, some groups have been further marginalized, including women and youth.",0
"They experience few development opportunities and minimal health, education, and social benefits.",1
"The Report recommends that in order to remove barriers to social inclusion, it is necessary to improve equitable access to key resources, to empower socially marginalized groups (including indigenous peoples) by developing local capacities, and to adopt a participatory approach to planning and implementation of development initiatives.   ",3
Mismanagement of natural resources and infrastructure Achieving environmental sustainability is one of the biggest challenges in the Niger Delta region.,1
Environmental degradation has resulted from poor management of natural resources and is a major source of agitation for inhabitants in this region.,-2
"In particular, pollution from the oil industry has destroyed key environmental resources such as land, water, and forests, and has crippled local livelihoods that depend on these resources.",-1
"Data show that the largest oil spills have occurred in the Rivers state, where there are large populations of indigenous peoples, and have resulted in the devastation of major food sources.",-1
"In addition, the general neglect of infrastructure has worsened people™s access to   key resources for sustainable living, such as electricity, safe drinking water, and health care facilities.",1
"The Report also indicates that poverty is both a major cause and a result of environmental degradation, and without proper environmental management initiatives the poor suffer from insufficient livelihoods, insecurity, and poor health.",-6
"Interestingly enough, the correlation between poverty and environmental degradation was presented in the Report using a case study of indigenous peoples in Brazil and the non-indigenous peoples who are encroaching and degrading their native lands.  ",-2
"With the present rate and degree of degradation, the Report states that the Delta may be heading toward ecological disaster.",-2
"To prevent further environmental and infrastructure degradation, the Report calls for the proper management of resources, raising environmental awareness, and enforcing environmental laws.",0
Some believe that total resource control is the only solution.,0
"Here the Report mentions the plight of the Ogoni people, who ﬁsee the right to ownership and control of their lands and resources as the only way to protect their environment from further degradation and promote decent livelihoods on Ogoni land.ﬂ30",1
"It also includes a copy of the Kaiama Declaration,31 which is a declaration of the rights of the Ijaw peoples to their territories and a call for self-determination.  ",0
"The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria impedes human development and remains the biggest obstacle in achieving MDGs, with the highest incidence rates in the Niger Delta.",-1
Nigeria also has one of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the world.,0
Lack of access to basic health services and the poor quality of health care facilities are major contributors to the high incidences of child and maternal mortality.,-2
"There is a lack of available longitudinal data for infant and maternal mortality rates in the Niger Delta region, and the Report does not provide disaggregated data that indicates the health situation of indigenous peoples, although low life expectancy in the Niger Delta is an indicator for high mortality rates.  ",0
"Conflict Challenges in sustainable human development include conflicts over resources among local communities, including indigenous communities, as well as between communities and oil companies.",0
Of particular concern are the disillusioned youth who turn to gangs and engage in extortion and fast moneymaking schemes due to lack of education and opportunities.,-3
Conflicts also arise in response to poor human development as well as mismanagement and corruption in the local government.,-2
A major issue in the Niger Delta region is access to land.,-1
Local people complain about having lost their lands to the oil industry.,-2
Displacement and alienation of people from their lands have led to conflicts in land rights as well as inefficient land use practices.,-1
"Land disputes have also resulted in inter-ethnic conflicts, and some of the most noteworthy conflicts involved indigenous peoples.  ",-1
Many have also lost their land through pollution and degradation resulting from quarrying activities.,-2
"As a result, many people, including indigenous people, are calling for restitution for damages caused by oil operations.",-1
"The Ogoni people, in particular, developed a Bill of Rights32 to list their grievances with the oil industry over environmental despoliation, demanding rights to and protection of their lands and environmental resources.",0
"However, the lack of avenues for redress against the big oil companies has also been a source of conflict in the Niger Delta region.   ",-2
Conclusions,0
"Despite efforts to boost economic growth, the Niger Delta struggles to achieve MDGs.",0
"Abject poverty, conflict, high mortality rates, and poor governance and management of infrastructure and natural resources have become major obstacles in meeting MDG targets and human development goals.",-3
"The HDR calls for Nigeria to implement a people-centeredŠnot income-centeredŠdevelopment agenda, particularly for the Niger Delta region, to overcome these hurdles, as well as to invest in efforts to revitalize traditional economic activities and promote sustainable livelihoods.  ",3
The Report proposes a seven-point people-centered development agenda that involves targeted efforts to build the region™s human capital using oil wealth in order to facilitate development in other sectors.,1
"This includes (1) promoting peace as a foundation for development, which involves equitable distribution of resources and protection of land rights; (2) ensuring good governance; (3) improving and diversifying the economy, which involves identification of new enterprises; (4) promoting social inclusion, which involves empowering marginalized groups, women, and youths to take an active part in shaping policies that affect their lives; (5) promoting a sustainable environment; (6) developing an integrated approach to combating HIV/AIDS; and (7) developing partnerships  for sustainable human development.   ",8
"The HDR gives comprehensive analysis of the current state of development in the Niger Delta, and includes information on the social and economic situations of indigenous peoples in the region.",1
"It states that various entities were consulted and focus groups were conducted to gather information for the Report, and participants were selected to avoid bias.",-1
"It is unclear, however, to what extent indigenous peoples were included or solicited to participate in these discussions.",-1
